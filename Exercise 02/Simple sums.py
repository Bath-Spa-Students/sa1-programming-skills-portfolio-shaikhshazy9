"""Exercise 2: Simple Sums - 15 Marks

In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arith-
metic operations, and print the result to the console.
Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console."""
#Step 1 : Create a variable with the number 8.
a = 8 

#Step 2 : Create another variable with the number 10.
b = 10 

#Step 3 : Add both of the numbers and save the result.
total = a + b

#Step 4: Show the result on the screen
print("The sum is:", total) #print the sum (8+10)
